TO-DO list for Adjoint data - 2021.0522

of the reprocessed data using mts

dacsjv new AVOC08 Nit Sp  seems to have no data.  this is AVOC for Aug Night  

some spots are green, but hoover shows no data.  maybe bug in JS?  Used firefox.

why debug says dacsjvnew ?? 

NOx loads but also no hoover for data.

apparently hoover stooped working, likely related to new data load via MTS...  layer name changed?

the hoover was looking for "val", but now data stripped to only have "max".
or the other way around... 
but cuz i tried to reduce file size and removed unused/redundant fields.
