seir model.

non-transmission/transmission model
all the way to agent model

what is the level of detail needed to answer the question.
never use more complex model than needed.
but sometime q has lots of complex, but don't have the data.
don't try to fit the data, lack rigor, so just to try to find general pattern.
summary stats of the data.
o

netwrok vs seir model.
network maybe very interesting.
