this dir contains a number of git projects pulled from the web.
as I am learning BEAST, found pulling these repo and placing files here was the most natural thing for the setup.

but they should not be checked into my own git repo "inet-dev-class".

these are

travHistProtocol/   -- see README.rst in this dir
beagle-lib/         -- see beagle.rst, for building the libs, may need to replicate at other sites

BEASTv1.10.5pre_thorney_0.1.2 -- downloaded tgz on zyzyxia: beast  beauti  loganalyser  logcombiner  treeannotator  treestat

tracer/ -- java gui from https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/

figTree -- tree viewer, expect http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ , but down

DensiTree - another tree viewer, .jar file from https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/DensiTree/
        java -jar DensiTree/DensiTree.v2.2.7.jar
