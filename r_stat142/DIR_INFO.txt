R lab (required) and assignments (optional) for Stat 142 (Spring 2022)
from datahub terminal, in 

IP of datahub is??   probably in the cloud, tmp: ufw disable

https://publichealth.datahub.berkeley.edu/user/tin/rstudio/


first copy on 2022.0122, beginning of the semester, most files are not released yet.
i have done edit to lab01.Rmd, about to submit to autograder.
no work on hw yet.
may be won't be syncing them unless really want to use local Rstudio, which i likely won't, as submission may become a mess.

consider copying files at end of semester...
